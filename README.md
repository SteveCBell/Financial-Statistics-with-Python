# Financial-Statistics-with-Python
This repository contains code and data for 'Financial Statistics with Python'. This course will take you through how to use NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, SciPy,
ARMA and statsmodels to analyse and understand financial data series. It will cover data acquisition from public sources such as the
Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) using the Pandas data reader through to building predictive models with statsmodels. The emphasis 
will be on exploring non-normal behaviour using realworld data. Some of the implications for risk management and trading will be considered.

The financial level of the course will be similar to my book "Quantitative Finance for Dummies" John Wiley 2016. You can buy the book
on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantitative-Finance-Dummies-Steve-DPhil/dp/1118769465/ref=sr_1_2?crid=25H7ZDNELHTM5&keywords=quantitative+finance&qid=1694182500&s=books&sprefix=quantitative+finance%2Cstripbooks%2C56&sr=1-2)
